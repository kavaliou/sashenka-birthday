        I hope you have a great day!<br/><br/>
        But wait, why this in English?!<br/>
        And I will tell you why.<br/><br/>
        I know that you are going to travel a lot, it means you will meet many languages. Am I right?<br/><br/>
        And not only travel, but also live in other countries, so in some cases you will need to learn language of that country. Am I right?<br/><br/>
        So, you have to be able to quickly understand other languages. Am I right?<br/><br/>
        I wish you to have this ability, be curious and open to everything new.<br/><br/>
        P.S. To open something new - just touch a beautiful animal that is mostly living in the mountains of the country named Peru in South America. By the way, official language of Peru is Spanish. Hola amigo!<br/>
        P.P.S. You can use "Google Translate" in the browser ;)
